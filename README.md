# Coding-Katas
This repository is a collection of exercises that I have done to hone my programming skills.
The intention is to improve myself in the field by trying to integrate the idea of test-driven development while I work on these small exercises,
while practicing good software engineering principles, despite the scale of these exercises being relatively small.
